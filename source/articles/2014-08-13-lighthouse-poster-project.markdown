I recently had the crazy idea to draw all of the lighthouses that currently
exist in the state of Michigan.  I thought there were going to be a couple
dozen.  Turns out, there’s more than 100.  I spent several days compiling a list
of all the lighthouses that are still standing, complete with their height,
birth year, and nearest city.


Then I started drawing…


Eventually I hope to make a giant print of all of them, but I have a long way to
go before that happens.  In the meantime, I just spend a lot of time reading
about lighthouses and talking about lighthouses and sometimes actually visiting
lighthouses.
