I recently drew a poster for some local bands on a fancy iMac at the University of Michigan. I made this fun timelapse using Quicktime:

And if you are curious about Pamola, the man-moose-eagle spirit that lives on Katahdin in Maine, you can read [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pamola
) wikipedia article. Basically, he gets grumpy sometimes and then storms happen. I went to visit him shortly before drawing this poster.
