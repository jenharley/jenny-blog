A couple years ago I got bored at work and started sketching cute fish on this yellow legal pad:

A couple months ago, I took all those sketches to UM’s GroundWorks Media Lab and redrew all the fish on one of the Wacom Cintiqs they have there.

A couple days ago I checked out a mini Cintiq from the Ann Arbor library and finished drawing all the cute fish!

It’s ready for screen printing now, so hopefully I can attempt to do that this summer sometime…
