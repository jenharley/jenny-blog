Here are a couple of fun maps I made while planning a 5-day adventure to Michiganâ€™s Upper Peninsula.  

The first map is for Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore, where we hiked about 25 miles along Lake Superior.

The second map is for Tahquamenon Falls State Park, where we only hiked about a mile section of the North Country Trail; we spent most our time fishing and hanging out at the brewery :)
