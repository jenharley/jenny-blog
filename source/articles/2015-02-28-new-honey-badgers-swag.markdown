I occasionally play on a hockey team called the Ann Arbor Honey Badgers.  We
needed a logo, so I whipped up this one last summer:

Hopefully new jerseys are coming soon, but in the meantime, it looks pretty good
on these t-shirts:

We also just celebrated the annual Honey Badger “Winterfest” (which is basically
just an excuse for everyone to hang out in the snow and not play hockey for a
weekend).  This year’s Winterfest took place in Ottawa, so we could all skate
down the Rideau Canal (world’s biggest ice rink!). Everyone got one of these
awesome hats (for which I designed a custom Honey Badger Winterfest patch!):

And here’s a photo of the Honey Badgers in action. That’s me getting run over by
some guy in green socks.
