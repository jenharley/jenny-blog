826michigan recently asked me to be part of their new postcard project for their robot shop (read about 826michigan and the Liberty Street Robot Supply & Repair here: http://www.826michigan.org or here: http://onwardrobots.com). The project combines short excerpts of student writing and local illustrators to create fun multi-purpose postcards for the robot shop.  I was given a list of about 20 different writings to choose from.  Ultimately, I chose the line 
>She was sad because she had to meet one hundred 
>monsters. She was happy because she had flowers.

written by a student at Perry Child Development Center in Ypsilanti. Some of my other favorites were:
>Emily wanted to be a scientist like Lanie, but Lanie said, “If you want to be a scientist, you can’t just eat pizza.”

and

>He was a stereotypical nerd who loved recycling and wearing recycled sweaters that itched like they were made of pine cones (which they were, of course).

Here’s how it turned out:

I drew my postcard using a Wacom Cintiq, which made it extra fun.
