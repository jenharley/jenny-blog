My good friend Chris Bathgate asked me to help him make a “crankie” style promo
video for his upcoming tour.  The video turned out to be a 96 ft long
illustration of all the cities he will be playing in.  It took forever to draw,
but it was pretty fun, and I learned a little bit about a bunch of cities I’ve
never been to (Did you know that the Goodyear blimp lives in Akron?!).  I also
attempted to learn how to use Adobe After Effects to turn my illustration into a
scrolling movie, but that was a little bit of a disaster (thanks to Pete Woodman
for figuring out that part).

You can watch the video (and also hear a new song by Chris called Northern
Country Trail) here:
