My friend Jim Roll just released an album many years in the making.  He told me the record, called *The Continuing Adventures of the Butterfly Kid*, was inspired by futuristic comic book art by Paul Pope. He asked for something based loosely on that, with this additional information:
>“It's like the year 2046 or so and it's a post apocalyptic world like NYC. The butterfly kid is a young girl superhero kind of.  Kind of a dark world in tatters but somehow still warm and inviting under the surface...”

This is what I came up with:

My butterfly kid may or may not have been inspired by this awesome Fox moto jacket that my friend Sky gave me:
